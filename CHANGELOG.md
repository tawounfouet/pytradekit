## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added

- Order primitives: OrderId, OrderSide, OrderType, TimeInForce, OrderStatus, ExecutionCertainty.
- Order aggregate with explicit lifecycle transitions, invariants, events, and errors.
- Canonical Fill, FillId, ExecutionReport, ExecutionStatus, SubmissionResult, and CancelResult.
- Consumer-owned ExecutionPort and OrderRepository.
- InMemoryOrderRepository.
- Deterministic FakeExecutionAdapter and FakeExecutionScenario.
- SubmitOrder, CancelOrder, HandleExecutionReport, ProcessFill, and GetOrder use cases.
- Immutable OrderSnapshot read DTO.
- Stable fill deduplication semantics.
- Submission and cancellation uncertainty semantics without blind retry.
- Query-based convergence for uncertain submission.
- Out-of-order acceptance protection.
- Cancel/fill race handling.
- End-to-end OMS qualification tests.
- Fault and race qualification tests.
- OMS & Execution architecture guide.
- Orders and Fake Execution guides.
- Executable market-order, uncertainty, and cancel/fill race examples.

### Quality

- 0.2 E2E scenarios run in the normal pytest suite.
- duplicate fills are mechanically qualified as one economic effect.
- terminal-state monotonicity is mechanically qualified.
- timeout uncertainty is mechanically qualified.
- cancellation uncertainty blocks blind resubmission.
- wheel qualification runs all executable examples in a clean virtual environment.
- GitHub Release workflow re-runs release qualification before publishing artifacts.
- wheel, sdist, and SHA256SUMS are attached to the versioned GitHub Release.
